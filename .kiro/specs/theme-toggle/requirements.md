# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current dark-mode-only application into a dual-theme system with user-controlled theme switching. The implementation will leverage Tailwind CSS's built-in dark mode variant system to provide both light and dark themes, with a toggle component available on all pages for seamless theme switching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can choose the visual appearance that best suits my preferences and environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle THEN the application SHALL switch between light and dark themes
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL remember the user's previously selected theme preference
3. WHEN no previous preference exists THEN the system SHALL default to the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme)
4. WHEN the theme changes THEN all UI elements SHALL immediately reflect the new theme without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to be easily accessible on every page, so that I can change themes whenever needed without navigating to a settings page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the theme toggle SHALL be visible and accessible
2. WHEN the toggle is activated THEN it SHALL provide clear visual feedback indicating the current theme state
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the toggle SHALL be accessible via keyboard controls
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the toggle SHALL announce the current theme state and available actions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Tailwind's dark mode variant system, so that theme implementation is consistent and maintainable across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing themes THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's `dark:` prefix for dark mode styles
2. WHEN a component needs theming THEN it SHALL define both light (default) and dark variant styles
3. WHEN the dark mode class is applied to the document THEN all `dark:` variants SHALL become active
4. WHEN the dark mode class is removed THEN all components SHALL revert to their light theme styles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the light theme to be visually appealing and accessible, so that it provides a comfortable viewing experience in bright environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using light theme THEN text SHALL have sufficient contrast against light backgrounds for accessibility
2. WHEN using light theme THEN interactive elements SHALL be clearly distinguishable
3. WHEN using light theme THEN the color scheme SHALL be consistent across all pages and components
4. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not cause visual jarring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my preferred theme every time I visit the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a theme THEN the preference SHALL be stored in localStorage
2. WHEN the user returns to the site THEN their previous theme selection SHALL be automatically applied
3. WHEN localStorage is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to system preference
4. WHEN the user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL revert to system preference detection
