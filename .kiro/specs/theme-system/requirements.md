# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a light mode theme option to the personal portfolio website and consolidate all color definitions into a centralized system. The current site appears to use a dark theme, and users should be able to toggle between light and dark modes while maintaining the retro gaming aesthetic. Additionally, all color values should be centralized to improve maintainability and consistency across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio site, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can view the content in my preferred visual mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the system SHALL display a theme toggle control that is easily accessible
2. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark modes instantly
3. WHEN a user switches themes THEN the system SHALL persist their preference across browser sessions
4. WHEN a user returns to the site THEN the system SHALL remember and apply their previously selected theme
5. IF no theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL respect the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor using the light theme, I want all content to remain readable and visually appealing, so that the site maintains its professional appearance in both themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN light mode is active THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN light mode is active THEN all interactive elements SHALL remain clearly distinguishable and accessible
3. WHEN light mode is active THEN the retro gaming aesthetic elements SHALL be preserved with appropriate color adaptations
4. WHEN light mode is active THEN company logos and icons SHALL remain visible and properly contrasted
5. WHEN switching between themes THEN all components (Timeline, JobCard, SocialLink, etc.) SHALL adapt their colors appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all color definitions centralized in one location, so that I can easily manage and update the color scheme without hunting through multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all color values SHALL be defined in a single centralized location
2. WHEN a color needs to be updated THEN the developer SHALL only need to modify it in one place
3. WHEN adding new colors THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent naming convention and organization structure
4. WHEN using colors in components THEN developers SHALL reference semantic color names rather than hex/rgb values
5. IF custom CSS is needed THEN it SHALL use CSS custom properties that reference the centralized color system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, so that I can leverage existing utility classes while maintaining the centralized color system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL support theme-aware color utilities (e.g., bg-primary, text-secondary)
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN Tailwind utilities SHALL automatically adapt to the new color scheme
3. WHEN extending Tailwind configuration THEN custom colors SHALL be properly integrated into the Tailwind color palette
4. WHEN building the site THEN the theme system SHALL not significantly impact build performance or bundle size
5. IF custom CSS is needed alongside Tailwind THEN both SHALL use the same centralized color definitions
